Project Aim- Prediction of Credit Approval

Dev used- Machine Learning

About the project-
To predict whether a borrower will get approved for credit or not based on various features using a Machine Learning Algorithm
called Extreme Gradient Boosting. It is a powerful and flexible machine learning algorithm that can be used for classification, regression. 

Language Used: Python 

Libraries Used: pandas, numpy, seaborn, XGBoost, scikit-learn

My Learnings from this project-
- Structuring a project 
- data cleaning using various technniques such as handling missing values, encoding
- descriptive stats about the raw dataset
- visualisation of results after applying ML algos (in this one, I used XGBoost Classifier)

PS- This is my first project just to get a hands-on experience towards working on a simple dataset using Machine Learning. Thanks <3
